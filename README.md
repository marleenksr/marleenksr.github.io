My personal website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and deployed to GitHub Pages.  
Started on [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and inspired by [chronark.com](https://github.com/chronark/chronark.com).
